# Development

This folder is for enabling better development for the FSXA-API.

The `index.ts` file imports the FSXA-API from the `src` folder and makes all functions available so that you can test them directly during development.

There you can call them and see if the FSXA-API behaves as desired during development


## Getting Started 

Copy the `.env.template` file, rename it to `.env` and write there all needed variables.
These will be loaded during execution.

To start the test environment, you can enter the `npm run dev` in the terminal.
